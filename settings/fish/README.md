# Fish Shell 

## Theme
Install `oh-my-fish` and then `omf install bobthefish`.
I recommend `set theme_color_scheme base16-light`.

## Settings
`set -g default_user <your_normal_user>`, where `<your_normal_user>` is your username.

## Files
These theme settings and prompt customizations are set up for `bobthefish` theme, but may work with other themes just fine.
Copy `config.fish` and `functions/*` to `~/.config/fish/`.
